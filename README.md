# News-blog-with-pymongo-and-bottle

This repo hosts a news blog which is backed by [MongoDB](www.mongodb.org) for storing news. The blog uses [Bottle](www.bottle.org), web framework written in Python.

The views folder contains tpl files used by bottle to generate html pages at runtime. 
The static folder contains third party images or css files that are used by the blog.

#### This is the front page from where the news source is selected.
